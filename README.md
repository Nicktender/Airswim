# Airswim
Airswim is a mod that lets you swim in the air. This is a legal designed to only work in *MODDED* lobbies. The mod will deactivate upon leaving the code or joining a non-moddied room.
# How to use:
Install the mod by downloading the Airswim.zip here: https://github.com/Nicktender/Airswim/releases/tag/release
Once downloaded and put in your plugins folder, all you have to do if press the grip and you will be submerged in water.
The beach map is always loaded to prevent certain issues, so you may get minor preformance drops.
# Other notes
Im salty bc Shiba's shitty menu beat me to this first :/
The name Airswim is a play on a legal platforms mod, Airjump. I thought it was clever, ok???
Im not good at C# and Github and stuff so don't expect my stuff to work right
After you get rid of the water, you may still here everything muffled.
Im working on makine the mod feel and look nicer, but since I released it i may stop working on it
